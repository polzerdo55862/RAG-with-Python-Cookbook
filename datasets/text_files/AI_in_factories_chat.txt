Alex: That's a challenge, but over time, AI could reduce operational costs significantly. For example, AI systems like robotic process automation (RPA) can reduce manufacturing costs by as much as 20%. Plus, they improve safety by taking over dangerous tasks.

Sam: Safety is definitely a huge benefit. Did you know that in 2022, nearly 3 million workplace injuries occurred in the U.S., and many of them were in manufacturing? AI could prevent a lot of those accidents.

Alex: Exactly! And AI's precision is unmatched. For instance, machine vision systems can achieve 99% accuracy in quality control inspections, identifying defects that human eyes might miss.

Sam: That's impressive, but I still think over-reliance is risky. A 2023 report from MIT found that 60% of companies using AI in manufacturing faced challenges with system reliability. If something goes wrong, it could cause major disruptions.

Alex: Absolutely. Cybersecurity is another concern. Did you know that cyberattacks on industrial systems increased by 87% in the past two years? Factories implementing AI would need robust defenses to avoid being vulnerable.

Sam: Exactly. And it's not just about security—there's also the issue of ethics. Some experts warn that mass adoption of AI could exacerbate inequality if big corporations adopt it while smaller players are left behind.

Alex: That's true, but AI can also level the playing field in some cases. For example, cloud-based AI tools let smaller factories access advanced analytics without having to invest in expensive hardware.

Sam: Good point. I guess the key is finding balance—using AI for tasks where it excels, like hazardous work and quality control, while keeping humans in creative and problem-solving roles.

Alex: Agreed. If implemented thoughtfully, AI could revolutionize manufacturing while addressing many of these concerns. It's exciting to think about the future potential!

Sam: Definitely. I hope the industry can get it right. The impact could be transformative if done responsibly.
